I have no clue of what to put here. Still...

1) If you wish to add features to the Chuha robot, create a new PROTO, WORLD and DEFAULT_CONTROLLER and pull 
request these new files. They will be merged after a cursory check of the functionality.

2) If you wish to add a new algorithm or scenario, simply create a new WORLD and a new CONTROLLER.

3) If you wish to refactor or improve existing controllers, ensure that it works out well and DOCUMENT YOUR CHANGES.

I strongly recommend trying 1) or 2) instead of going directly for 3). Use option 3) only for bug fixes or for much-desired
changes or features.

This is a small project so far, with a single contributor as of now. I'm making this up as I go along, so if you have any 
suggestions, ping me at aniruddhkb@gmail.com .
