# swarm_robotics_webots
This is a repo containing my work in implementing common swarm robotics algorithms using the Webots simulator.

This has been tested on Webots R2020b Nightly Build 26/6/2020. Hopefully, this should work on your system as well.

To use this, simply clone this repo to a folder of your choice and open one of the world files in a repo. A good starting 
point would be /worlds/swarm_basic_flocking.wbt and /controllers/swarm_basic_flocking/swarm_basic_flocking.py (WARNING--
YET TO BE COMMENTED AND PENDING REFACTORING).

Please feel free to contribute through issues and pull requests.

I won't be making a Wiki yet, since there are so few files involved. This may change, and I believe in over-documentation as 
opposed to under-documentation. Still, it may be some time before I get to that stage.

Thanks for dropping by!
